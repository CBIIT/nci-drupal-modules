Field Defaults allows batch updating of default field values
to existing content.

INSTALLATION
------------

Copy the folder into your modules directory

USAGE
------------
  * This module works one field at a time
  * It provides an additional checkbox option in the Default Value
    section in the Manage Fields > Edit page for a given field
  * On save of the field edit screen, with this option checked, all
    entities with this field attached will be updated with this field's default
    value, regardless of whether another value already exists.
  * Nodes whose fields are updated retain their original node updated date/timestamp

MAINTENANCE
-------------

This project is not actively developed, but I will try to help
with any bugs/issues/etc.
