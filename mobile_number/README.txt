INTRODUCTION
------------

Mobile Number is a field type that provides mobile number validation and
verification, and can be used for two factor authentication. It works with
SMS Framework and TFA modules, respectively, and both features are optional.

The module differs from the Phone module in that it puts security and
authenticity first, and focuses on mobile numbers which therefore assumes sms
and smartphone capabilities by the user. The number is sanitized before saving,
country is validated, the number is validated to be a mobile number type,
allows uniqueness validation, and, if enabled, allows verifying number
ownership by the user. For verification, codes are hashed and tokenized in the
database. See the case for a dedicated mobile number field.

The module uses libphonenumber (developed by Google for use in Android) for
validation, and supports the mobile number formats of the countries listed
here (https://github.com/giggsey/libphonenumber-for-php/blob/master/src/
libphonenumber/ShortNumbersRegionCodeSet.php), which is basically all of them.

 * Webform
 * Telephone
 * Services
 * Devel
 * Views
 * TFA

INSTALLATION
------------

 * Install as you would normally install a contributed Drupal module. See:
   https://drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-7
   for further information.
 * Download into your libraries folder the libphonenumber project under the
   name libphonenumber. Or, if drush is enabled, you can use drush
   libphonenumber-download command. The libarary can be install using
   Composer Manager as well.

   setting up an account and paying fees on a 3rd party service, or use SMS
   Framework's default logger gateway for testing.
 * For two factor authentication, complete step 3 and download, enable, and
   configure TFA.
