INTRODUCTION

Current Maintainer: cecrs
The Site Alert module is a lightweight solution for allowing
site administrators to easily place an alert on their site,
for example for maintenance downtime, or any general
informational message. Alerts have start and end date/times,
and can be assigned a severity level. Messages are refreshed by
ajax and not subject to site caching, so changes made in the
ui will be automatically displayed to users without
necessitating a cache clear. The module provides a custom pane
(recommended) and a block for sites not using panels.
